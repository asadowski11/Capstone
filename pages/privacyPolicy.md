# Privacy Policy
We the developers of this application created it with privacy in mind. The application (called 'Bob' or 'him' after this) is careful about what it does with your private information. Bob does not collect and store your information. Bob may use specific parts of your information **only to directly perform the action you the user have requested it to do**. An example of this is for when you the user ask Bob to give you driving directions to a place. Bob will request your device's location to be used as the starting point and use that information to build a URL to the map provider you have told Bob you want him to use. Any external service that Bob may use to perform the action you requested of him has their own privacy policy on what they do with any data sent to them. Bob does not harvest your user data, and has no data-collecting capabilities. Any information you give bob (such as voice recordings created by you the user) are stored on the user's local machine and are not uploaded to any kind of remote machine by means of Bob.
