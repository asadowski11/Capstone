# Download
Currently Bob is not ready to be downloaded yet, but will be available for general release around April 30th. Why is that? Because this is starting as a capstone project for college, and April 30th is when the capstone is due.

# About Bob

## Google and Amazon's digital assistants are useful, right?
They help you set alarms and reminders, get the weather, look up information, and even tell jokes among a whole plethora of other helpful things. I personally use the Google assistant myself, and have found it to be a great convenience. Then I started paying attention to the news, about how [Alexa stores your voice recordings on Amazon's servers](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/19/how-to-delete-amazon-alexa-conversations.html), and how [One of Google's assistant devices can pick out your face as you're walking by it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/09/google-is-always-listening-now-its-watching-too-with-nest-hub-max/). 

To me, that's both creepy _and_ unnecessary. An assistant doesn't have to know who you are in order to be useful. An assistant doesn't have to collect every drop of information on you and abuse your implicit trust in it by making money off of that information. An assistant doesn't have to always be listening. The 2 major digital assistants do these things and more. "But why would they do this?" you might ask, disbelieving that a company with the motto of "don't be evil" would commit acts of evil against your personal privacy. The answer is simple: _companies are out to make as much money as possible_. How does Google make money with all these free services? It's simple, through [targeted ads using your information as fuel](https://safety.google/privacy/ads-and-data/). Amazon does the same thing, [they explicitly state it in their privacy notice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909010#GUID-1B2BDAD4-7ACF-4D7A-8608-CBA6EA897FD3__SECTION_7CE768C1281346DAAF87CE795E8B3610).

I'm not saying that these companies shouldn't be making money, and I'm not saying that using anonymized user information to place ads is innately evil. Everyone needs to put food on the table, even the people in massive companies. What I _am_ against, however, is how these companies handle their privacy policies that you might not have known you "agreed" to. Sure they provide a link to their privacy policies when you first sign up to their service, but honestly we're kind of _forced_ to agree to them if we want to shop online at the largest internet retailer, or use the best search engine out there (along with all of their other services). 

## Meet Bob, the digital assistant that cares about your privacy.
Bob was created because we need something that the other assistants aren't -- a good digital assistant that you can use without having to worry about what's happening with your data.

Want to get the weather in your local area? Sure, **Bob won't store your location anywhere after using it**. 
Want Bob to stop listening? Absolutely, **just turn off the setting in the app that allows Bob to listen to your voice**.
[Want to have a private conversation without worrying that your assistant will send what your saying to remote servers](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/24/amazon-alexa-recorded-conversation)? You got it, **Bob doesn't even have the capability to do that**.

***Bob does not use your information for anything except to directly perform the action you just asked him to do.*** This is how digital assistants should have been from the start, useful without harvesting your private information.

## But how can you prove that you don't steal my data too?
That's the question you should be asking. It's a classic move, saying you're better than someone/something else becaue you don't do x but then secretly do it behind their back. This type of question is hard to answer, because it's hard to prove that you're not doing something when the person asking the question is distrustful. We believe the best way to answer this question is to make Bob [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) from the start. The entire edit history of Bob, as well as the code and resources that currently make him run are viewable by everyone. We know that code isn't readable by everyone, but we also know that the simple act of publicizing all the internals of our assistant is an action that speaks loudly on its own. We hope that members of the open source community will help us in making the best digital assistant out there, one that does not stoop so low as to harvest user information.
